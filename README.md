## Introduction

In this project, you will add class components to your a basic ecommerce site that allow you to request product data from a server and render that data. You will also implement the ablitity to add products to a shopping cart.

#### Shopping Cart

  Nothing needs to be done here. You _will_ have to navigate to the cart page in your app so you can go to the checkout form for the next step.


**Notes:**
* Again, unlike other projects, the local server used here can not be accessed through the browser.  Test the functioning of the server directly through your axios calls.
